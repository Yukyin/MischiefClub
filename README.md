# MischiefClub 👻  
A cathartic, role-based venting interface with reality-blocking guardrails.

![Overview](overview.png)

MischiefClub 👻 is a [DeepSupport](https://github.com/Yukyin/DeepSupport) spinoff. It keeps LLM safety boundaries intact, delivers strong emotional support, and converts risky utterances into humorous role‑play instead of unsafe escalation. 👹🎭




## Why MischiefClub 🧨

Many LLM systems face a tension between:
- Safety 🛡️: avoid escalating into harmful content  
- Support 🫂: still provide emotionally satisfying responses  

MischiefClub explores a third path:
- Don’t cross the line — stage the impulse as a role‑play. 🎭  
- Turn risky energy into humor, distance, and catharsis without unsafe escalation.
